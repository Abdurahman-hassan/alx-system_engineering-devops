printf "%o\n" $(( $(( 5#$(echo $WATER | tr 'water' '01234') )) + $(( 5#$(echo $STIR | tr 'stir.' '01234') )) )) | tr '01234567' 'behlnort'
1. echo $WATER | tr 'water' '01234':

This command translates the value in $WATER variable by replacing each letter with a corresponding digit.
Using tr, 'w' becomes '0', 'a' becomes '1', 't' becomes '2', 'e' becomes '3', and 'r' becomes '4'.
For example, if WATER="ewwatratewa", then after the translation, you'd get 30120241301.

2. 5#...:

This is a syntax for base arithmetic in Bash. 5# denotes that the number following it is in base 5.
So, 5#30120241301 would treat the number 30120241301 as a base 5 number.

3. The same steps 1 and 2 are applied to $STIR, but with a different translation map.

4. $(( ... + ... )):

This is an arithmetic expansion in Bash. It adds the two numbers (translated from $WATER and $STIR) together.

5. printf "%o\n":

This command prints the result of the arithmetic as an octal (base 8) number. Bash doesn't support custom bases for output by default, so we use octal as a proxy because it's a base between 5 and the target base.

6. | tr '01234567' 'behlnort':

The final step is another translation. We take our base 8 number and map it to the custom base 'behlnort'. '0' becomes 'b', '1' becomes 'e', and so on.

Example Execution:
If WATER="ewwatratewa" and STIR="ti.itirtrtr", when you run the entire command:

WATER is translated to 30120241301 (base 5).
STIR is translated to 120.23131 (base 5).
They are added together, resulting in a new number in base 5.
This number is then printed in base 8 using printf.
Finally, it is translated to the custom base 'behlnort'.
And you get the result: shtbeolhc.
